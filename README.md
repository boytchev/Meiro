# Meiro
Meiro is a gaming environment populated with interactive 3D models.
It is a successor of the FMI-3D project. Currently Meiro contains
over 300 models covering different topic from Computer Graphics.
Meiro is used in the course "Fundamentals of Computer Graphics" for
Computer Sciences undergraduate students from the
[Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en) at
[Sofia University](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/eng). 

# Important note
The Meiro project is currently being githubbed. It will take some
time until the old code is refactored and polished. This document
will present on the elements that are fixed.

# Floor plan
During the game students may view the floor plan of Meiro. This is
a map of floors, rooms, locations of models, etc.

### Examples
Click on an image to run live demos of different Meiros. They are
generated at run time, so every time they will show a different 
allocation of rooms.
