Meiro is a gaming environment populated with interactive 3D models.
It is a successor of the FMI-3D project. Currently Meiro contains
over 300 models covering different topic from Computer Graphics.
Meiro is used in the course "Fundamentals of Computer Graphics" for

# Important note
The Meiro project is currently being githubbed. It will take some
time until the old code is refactored and polished. This document
will present on the elements that are fixed.
